# 📘 Student Record Management System (C++)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Record Management System** is a beginner-friendly, console-based C++ application that allows users to manage student records.

This project was built to practice core C++ programming concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), vectors, functions, and control structures.

## 🚀 Features

 Add a new student
 View all students
 Search student by ID
 Delete student by ID
 Menu-driven interface

---

##  Project Structure

The program includes:

* A `Student` class to represent student data
* A `vector<Student>` to store multiple student records
* Separate functions for each operation:

  * `addStudent()`
  * `displayStudents()`
  * `searchStudent()`
  * `deleteStudent()`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* Classes and objects
* Vectors (STL)
* Loops (`for`, `do-while`)
* Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
* Boolean logic
* Functions
* Basic input/output

---

## Student Data Fields

Each student record contains:

 `int id`
 `string name`
 `int age`
`string grade`

---

##  How the Program Works

1. The program displays a menu.
2. The user selects an option.
3. The corresponding function executes.
4. The student list is updated or displayed.
5. The menu repeats until the user exits.

## 🛠 How to Compile and Run

Using g++:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o student_system
./student_system
```

Using an IDE:

* Open the project file
* Click Run

## 📌 Example Menu

```
===== Student Record Management System =====
1. Add Student
2. View All Students
3. Search Student by ID
4. Delete Student
5. Exit
```

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I learned:

* How to structure a C++ application
* How to use classes with vectors
* How to implement a simple CRUD system
* How to organize logic into reusable functions

---

## Future Improvements

* Save student records to a file
* Add update/edit student feature
* Prevent duplicate student IDs
* Add input validation
* Create a GUI version
